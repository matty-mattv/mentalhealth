## Inspirations
We all were pretty impacted by amounts of stress that comes with schools and the events around our lives and we never stopped to realizes that not taking care of it was going to kill us eventually.

One of our teammates has a friend who suffered from bipolar, but yet she seemed to realize the importance of self-care. Her story inspired me to try and see how we can make a difference at this hackathon.

## What It Does
This app is a daily journal to help analyze and improve a persons's mental health through words of encouragement (using natural language processions) and a daily selfie to remind users to love themselves.
